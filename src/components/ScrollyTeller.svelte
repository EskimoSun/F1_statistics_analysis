          Both Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher are towering figures in the world of Formula 1 racing and world champions. One being the first and only black driver in the sports to achieve a height that no other person had, and the other being synonymous with Ferrariâ€™s success, laying down unbeatened records in the early 2000s.   
        </p>
        <br>
        <span style='font-weight:bold;font-size:25px;text-align:center'>But can we really tell who is the better driver?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          In Formula 1, in order to become a world champion, you would have to earn enough racing points and be on top of the leaderboard at the end of a season. By winning each round of grand prix races, or finishing in a high positon, you would get the crucial victory points. Both Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton share the record of 7 world championship titles, which would cement their legendary status in the motorsports hall of fame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lewis Hamilton's F1 career started in 2007 and immediately started collecting race wins left, right, and center, even when he was facing head-to-head against his already-accomplished, world champion teammate. But he only started dominating the sports in 2014, when had partnered with Mercedes as his team, even till today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael Schumacher's name reigns as one of the most famous drivers anyone has ever heard. His debut in 1991 as a F1 driver was mostly unexpected, but through serious dedication and fierce pace, he earned himself a reputation of strength and tenacity. His cooperation with Ferrari from 1996 to 2006 has secured him a racing legacy well respected by fans everywhere. In his dominance, no other driver could get close to the speed that he exhibited.

Both drivers had mediocre seasons when their team's car simply lacked the speed to rank at the front of the grid. Luckily, both drivers had 7 phenomenal seasons when they had won the championship.

          <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">When boiling down to their absolute most dominant season, Schumacher shows <span style="color: #ff9729; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px">an overwhelming overtake</span> in most statistics.</p>

          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">But the details on whichever driver is the greater driver is ambiguous. Discussed in our additional information, many factors such as points system, strategy, and tyre plays such an effect on the statistics of the driver that by simply looking at the numbers <span style="color: #ff9729; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px"> couldn't be conclusive. </span></p>
